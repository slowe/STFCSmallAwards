The aims of the workshops are to enthuse the pupilsabout magnetism and superconductivity, physics and science, allow pupils to observe andinteract with a range of magnetism and superconductivity phenomena, give an appropriateexplanation of the phenomena to the pupils, raise the awareness of the pupils about currentresearch and everyday applications in the fields of magnetism and superconductivity andsupport the teaching and learning of magnetism in the curriculum.The workshops will take the form of a range of demonstrations which pupil volunteers canassist with, interspersed with explanations using a few powerpoint slides/videos to illustratea point. Pupils will also be asked to investigate different magnetic phenomena in smallgroups. Members of the project team will circulate during these times, assisting andanswering questions. Teachers will be given a CD containing resources for 3 follow-uplessons: these will be stand-alone lessons and the activities can be slotted into schools'existing teaching schemes as appropriate.
Mr N A BallSouth Cheshire Astronomical SocietyBringing the Sun down to EarthAward: £5,000The Society have previously undertaken a number of local outreach activities and with thisproject, will be targeting local communities and schools, providing individuals with anopportunity to see dynamic activity on the surface of the Sun using a dedicated and portablesolar telescope, allowing individuals to undertake genuine observations in order to improvetheir engagement with science, encourage teachers to include astronomy in the schoolcurriculum as an ongoing legacy, whilst motivating the students to pursue a career inscience by demonstrating real world physics in action. They will also develop a blueprintthat can be rolled out across other regions, provide an ongoing resource for use by localschools / colleges.An initial explanation of the observed phenomena will be provided by a professional solarastronomer. This will be the primary route for the training of the applicants and othermembers of the project. An important aspect of the project is its hands-on nature. By usingspecialist equipment in real time we aim to excite individuals, particularly school children /college students, with the positives to be gained from actual use of instrumentation.The project will provide training to school / college teachers in the use of the equipment sothat they become self sufficient and are able to incorporate the use of it into their classes.Upon the successful completion of training, SCASTRO will loan the out equipment to supportthis activity.Dr A J BarrUniversity of OxfordBig Bang Physics: A prototype smart phone applicationAward: £2,570This projects aims are to to develop and evaluate a prototype software application thatwould be compatible with any mobile phone or tablet computer running the AndroidOperating System. The same application could also be hosted on a website, available toanyone with a connection to the internet. This project intends to generate interest in andeducate people about particle physics; in particular the experiments at the Large HadronCollider at CERN.The application is eventually intended to be released without charge on the AndroidMarket, which is used by developers to distribute applications to any smart phone or tabletPC running the open-source Android operating system. It would be freely available todownload by anyone with an Android device. Among its features would be a simplified
event display, similar to the ATLAS ATLANTIS event display that could display the ATLASdetector and the physical collision events in a highly interactive way on a small screen.Mr P BondField Studies Council, CumbriaTo install an Observatory as an evening activity for teenagersAward: £9,511This project is aimed at capturing and developing the inquisitiveness displayed by youngpeople about astrobiology and the search for life, and use it to inspire future generations ofscientists. Castle Head is situated in rural Cumbria and enjoys dark skies. As a residentialField Studies Centre it hosts young people at night time and offers a range of eveningactivities for the students. It aims to inspire the next generation of scientists by providingreal hands on scientific activities and project work, alongside real scientists.A 'Sky Shed Pod' observatory will be purchased and installed in the grounds of Castle Head.A member of staff will be trained in the use of the Sky Shed Pod and all its equipment bystaff at STFC Daresbury. Their training will ensure that they have the knowledge and abilityto run short night time sessions or to liaise with visiting teachers who wish to run their ownpractical sessions to support their curriculum. The project will be actively marketed toschools in the NW offering GCSE Astronomy and also science specialist schools.Mr J B Coppersmith HeavenScottish Storytelling ForumIn the Beginning... Stories from the Science of our OriginsAward: £2,210The objective of this project is to facilitate the writing of 8 new stories that can beappreciated by people both from a non-scientific and scientific background. The stories willgive an insight into the origins of our universe, and particular aspects of it; gravity, light,planets, stars, black holes, matter and anti-matter, etc.A group of four writers, two storytellers, two scientists, one creative writing facilitator andthe award holder, who will also be a facilitator, will take part in a creative writing workshop,creating a set of stories that give cosmological science a clear and cohesive narrative,related to the audience in a way that is dramatic, memorable, inspiring, and educational.The overall impact is aimed at providing a more engaging way for people to understand thediscoveries of science. Two events will be held in Dumfries & Galloway, with a further eventat the Scottish Storytelling Centre where illustrated booklets available to buy. There will alsobe audio recordings of the stories available via a website.
Professor J C DoreUniversity of KentSchools outreach and public lectures on neutron and x-ray researchAward: £2,000This project will fund the delivery of talks and workshops, over the period of a year, toschools and the public on the subjects of neutron and x-ray research. The use of neutronand x-ray techniques across a large range of subject areas is not well-represented in themedia and, despite its important contribution to scientific knowledge, gives the impressionof being under-valued.The aim of the talks and workshops will be to inform students, teachers and the generalpublic about the use of central [neutron/x-ray] facilities for characterisation of materials,particularly disordered systems such as liquids [water], glasses, crystals and othercondensed matter systems. Specific topics will be given under the titles 'Water: the magicof molecular science' and 'Carbon nanotubes: the next revolution in materials science' butother presentations will also be developed.Dr R JarmanQueen's University, BelfastProject 500: Exploiting Public Libraries as Informal Science Learning EnviromentsAward: £7,100The aims of the project are twofold: to raise the profile of public libraries as valuableresources for informal science learning and to encourage children to borrow and readlibrary books relating to astronomy/physical science. This project aims to encourage andassist public libraries in Northern Ireland to incorporate science-related activities into theirprogrammes. It will be run in four public library settings in Northern Ireland, to includeurban, rural and areas considered to be socio-economically disadvantaged, participants willbe exploring the frontiers of our knowledge of astronomy / particle physics. The focus willbe on presenting the science in a stimulating and interesting manner and with a constantlink to the library's stock of science books and ICT resources. The range of books availablewill be emphasised, such as, for example, biographies, activity books, information books,guidebooks. In addition, the children and young people will be involved in informationsearches and they will be introduced to librarians as welcoming and supportive 'informationprofessionals'.Once the project is completed, the knowledge gained will be used to compile and produce aguide book on ways of using the public library to encourage and enable children and youngpeople to find out about astronomy, physics and, about science more generally. The booklet
will be designed for librarians to support and equip them so that the purposes of the projectmay have sustainability in the longer term.Dr D G JenkinsUniversity of YorkRutherford 2011Award: £5,540This project is to produce a set of DVD-based resources on nuclear physics which will be ofgreat use to school teachers, other educators and scientists for their own publicengagement work. This work is in recognition of the centenary of Rutherford's 'Discovery' ofthe nucleus in 1911 at the University of Manchester. 5000 copies of the DVD will beproduced and distributed to 1700 IoP-affiliated schools and other groups. Next year, 2011,will be a significant year in the history of Nuclear Physics, representing the 100thanniversary of Rutherford's paper which first introduced the concept of an atomic nucleus.The project will capitalise on the attention drawn to nuclear physics in 2011 and thissignificant centenary by producing a lasting set of materials and resources (many of whichalready exist) in a form suitable for school teachers, and members of the physics communityinterested in public engagement.The DVD will look at the science of nuclear physics, its history, how it takes place today andhow applications deriving from it are crucial in the modern world. A particular theme will be'how science works' using nuclear physics as a topical example. Nuclear physics led by UKgroups will be particularly emphasised as well as applications coming from UK science. It isproposed to distribute 1700 copies of the DVD to the IoP's affiliated schools as part of theirstandard mailings. It will also be distributed to all past, present and future attendees ofTeacher's Conferences on Nuclear Physics. As far as possible, the material once collated willbe uploaded onto the National HESTEM E-library which is hosted by the National ScienceLearning Centre.Miss M M KerssensGloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation TrustShining light on pathology: breast cancer screening with Raman spectroscopyAward: £4,105This project will provide an opportunity to demonstrate and communicate the sciencebehind technology. Although breast cancer and the need for breast cancer screening is quitewell featured in the media, very little attention is paid on ongoing research. The public isgenerally interested in this work but don't realise the kind of work actually done and thepotential implications. The public profile of research will be raised by developing a cancer
diagnostics workshop kit which can be used during festivals, presentations, lessons, anddemonstrations. The programme will be built around breast cancer, which is the mostcommon cancer among women in the UK. It will explore cutting edge work undertaken atSTFC developing methods of deep Raman spectroscopy and their application to thediagnosis of breast calcifications.An 'experiment kit' comprising of posters, presentations, quizzes and hands on experimentswill be developed use for workshop for school, work experience students, medical careeropen day and a local Science Festival.Miss K McGrathFuel Theatre LtdGoing Dark: a touring theatre performance about astronomy and perceptionAward: £5,000A touring theatre performance about astronomy will be developed and performed to schoolgroups and the public, exploring cosmology and blindness, through the story of a man whois working in a planetarium who which is gradually being commercialised, and who is losinghis sight. It will inform and enthuse audiences about the dynamics of vision, how it is appliedto both cosmic views and the everyday world we live in, making audiences aware of howvisual perception and optics have been a key aid to astronomy, and how sight is a fragiletool in our perceptual understanding of the world and the universe beyondTo offer audiences an understanding of how the brain interprets images, and how we makesense of a vast cosmos stretching the limits of our perception.It is intended that the performance will tour 11 venues around the country for a total of 52performances playing to 4,000 audience members.Miss C MolyneuxBalshaw's CE High School, LeylandSouth Ribble in SpaceAward: £7,000This project is intended to reach as many members of the South Ribble community aspossible, to enthuse, inspire and educate on all things astronomical during 2011. It will aimto provide a year of exciting, stimulating and interactive Science events for all ages to thecommunity. It will offer exciting opportunities for members of the local public to getinvolved with Science and the wonders of Space - ones that they would normally have to
venture further afield to get. It will involve 12 Secondary schools in South Ribble and anevent will be hosted each month, rotating around the schools.All the pupils, staff and parents will be invited to each Science event. These will range fromworkshops i.e. build basic telescopes, to lectures on Space and Astronomy themes. A crosscurricular aspect will be included by hosting debates, for example, that include religiousstudies departments e.g. Big Bang or not?Scientists from local Universities will be invited - the University of Manchester, theUniversity of Liverpool and the University of Lancaster; these will host lectures both duringthe day for pupils and in the evening for public attendance in our school hall on subjectsincluding evolutionary biology, microbiology and genetics. The project will aim to try outnew ways of Scientific communicaton. These include the use of animation; pupils will createanimations to show things like the ecliptic and path of the planets These will be exhibited inthe local museum as well as used during deliverance of lessons on the topics.Dr R TrottaImperial College LondonUrban Sputnik: Interactive CosmologyAward: £8,542Five Kinetic sculptures are to be produced to educate and inspire a diverse audience aboutcosmology and astrophysics. A website will be developed to inspire further learning andworkshops will be held surrounding the theories which inspired each sculpture. The aim ofthis project is to provide a sensorial experience in an urban setting with otherwise limitedvisibility of astronomical bodies.Whilst Urban Sputnik is primarily intended for science-inclined audience, it is hoped to makeit as accessible and as relevant as possible for groups of young people. The award holderswill work hand in hand with the institutions that will house the pieces, to integrate itwherever possible into their educational programmes. Due to the kinetic and interactivenature of the pieces, this project is educational in a non-conventional way, inviting theaudience to think about the universe in a way they may not have done previously.Mr A TrowUniversity of GlamorganLeading Space Education WalesAward: £4,980
This project plans to replicate successful aspects of the "Leading Space Education"programme being run in England by the SSAT and STFC to schools in the RCT Convergencezone. The successful model of close engagement to initiate the project, followed by goodteacher training and student workshops, will be undertaken by the award holders. They willdevelop a pilot astronomy programme, working with teachers, GCSE students and 6thformers in the RCT Convergence Zone, develop classroom resources and place them online,so that they are available nationally. The project will raise awareness of astronomy andspace science, and its social relevance, amongst 14-18 year olds.Teacher participants will be staff at these local schools, who will undertake the GalileoTeacher Training Programme, and be briefed and supported on establishing GCSEAstronomy at their schools. The family audience will be members of the students' familieswho attend the final part an "end-of-course" Astronomy Day event at Glamorgan, wherethere will be a final award ceremony for the participating students and poster displays forpeople to look at.Professor P M WatkinsUniversity of BirminghamA Cascade of Physics in and from Particle Physics ResearchAward: £2,600This project will invite A Level and GCSE students nationwide (flyers sent to 3000+ schools))to prepare, with support from their teachers and e-mail support from students/staff at theUniversity, a short, stimulating video relating to particle physics or the fundamentalprinciples behind some of the particle physics experiments. The topic will be chosen from asuggested list given or the students can submit their own idea for approval. The videos willlast 3-4 minutes and be aimed at a particular age group in school. Teams of 2-4 students willwork together and submit their entries on CD or memory stick by the beginning of April2011. A team at the University (researchers, teachers and PG students) will watch the videosand judge them against specified criteria, choosing up to 6 winners.The winning teams and their teachers will be invited into the University in June / July 2011for a celebration lunch, to include showing of the winning videos, presentation of prizes,discussions with staff and, hopefully, a live video link to researchers at CERN. Schoolsnationwide will then be invited to use them to introduce concepts in the classroom andenhance physics lessons.Dr K WebsterThinktank, Birmingham Science MuseumFrontiers and Barriers
Award: £5,000This award will fund the creation of three new Space related object handling collectionswhich will be taken out to organisations such as nursing homes and residential care homesfor adults with disabilities. Through these presenter-led, interactive and sensory learningexperiences, it will enable the residents to share the science, relevance and passion forspace technologies as well the wider STEM agenda. The objects will be on the themes of:• InventionsthroughSpaceResearch• SurvivalinSpace• SpaceJunkInventions through Space Research will include items such as Kevlar, Mylar, Teflon and theFisher Space pen. Survival in Space will feature items such as space food, aeroponics andspace suit components. The Space Junk handling collection will include items that are foundin space, both natural and man made, such as a meteorite sample, satellite components,aerogel and haematite. They will offer highly sensory and tactile experiences that we havepreviously demonstrated as being effective tools for stimulating dialogue within groups andalso leading to high impact learning.Participants can hold and closely examine the objects while the presenter facilitates theexploration of these objects through questions and information about them.For the audiences that have been identified for this project, physical access to the museumis a key barrier to visits, hence the initial outreach visits followed by visits to Thinktank,where they will be accompanied by their supporters.Professor B C AllanachUniversity of CambridgeGuerilla Science 2011Award: £9,500Using a blend of discussion, debate, live experiments, talks and performances, GuerillaScience aims to communicate various aspects of science and technology to a general publicaudience. These will be predominantly adults with little or no experience of science (butalso children and families) attending two music festivals in the UK during summer 2011.By participating in our programme scientists will be able to communicate more effectivelywith the public, improving on their existing skills and potentially learning new ones. Publicaudience will be informed of the latest activities in STFC-orientated areas of science andtechnology, and how the scientific process works through direct communication anddialogue between young scientists and non-scientists. It will also broaden the audience'sperceptions of what science is. Guerilla Science will create events that communicate the
exciting nature of scientific research today.

Theyaim to engage young people and the general public in science, highlight current researchand provide information on career opportunities in science.Other aims are to produce a series of presentations and supplementary materials relevantto schoolchildren (Key Stages (KS) 2-4 + A-Level) and the general public, and to offer talksand interactive activities to schools and local community groups. In the case of KS 4 andsixth form students, the project team will also offer careers talks, offering an opportunity foryoung people to directly question active research scientists. As an entirely female group,they hope in particular to encourage more young women to consider careers in science.Elsewhere in the local community, they will offer talks and interactive sessions to suchdiverse groups such as astronomical societies, scout and WI groups and the air cadets, withthe aim of raising awareness of and interest in science to those who would not normally beexposed to it.Successful applicants in round 2011ADr D ManeuskiUniversity of GlasgowSee Through Science - Engaging the Public with Cutting-Edge X-ray DetectorsAward: £9,550The principal aim of this project is to build a portable X-ray imaging system for use as aninteractive demonstrator. The system will be suitably designed to educate and excite a widevariety of the general public from younger school students to company CEOs. The systemwill consist of cutting-edge research X-ray detector, Medipix, a portable low-dose X-raytube, sample holder and attractive exhibition stand. It is hoped that the demonstratorwould be used to enhance the following events in 2011-2013:• IOPteacherdayStirlingandthePhysicsteachersummerschool-Inspiringteacherswith demonstrations of British/CERN technology• AllthirteensciencefestivalsthroughoutScotland-potentialtoreachlargenumbersof the general public
• Publicandfamily/Schooldays-fivesuchdaysareheldinGlasgowalone• Scottishtechnologyshowcases-industrialexhibitionandknowledgetransfer• UniversityofGlasgowindustrydays-knowledgetransfereventDr B StillQueen Mary, University of LondonLego PhysicsAward £2,000This project aims to use LEGO to represent the basic 'building block' constituents of matter,enabling students to understand quite abstract topics like nuclear and particle physics byphysically 'sticking things together'. This project is a spinoff from the successful 'Build yourown Universe' exhibit at the Big Bang Fair in London, which used LEGO to represent quarks,and explained the development of our Universe from the Big Bang to the end of time. Thiskit has been successfully used to deliver workshops at 4 schools. However, it is not stronglylinked to either the GCSE or A-Level syllabus, although it contains aspects of both, as theexhibit required a coherent 'storyline'. This grant will enable the development of the singleworkshop into two separate ones: one aimed at GCSE, the other at A-Level.The money from the grant will cover the cost of LEGO for the workshops and for the cost ofthe design of instruction booklets to match the ones for 'Build Your Own Universe'. Thesebooklets would include the instructions for the LEGO, as well as extra, syllabus-relevantinformation. We would then print and disseminate all three instruction booklets to all UK11-18 schools.Miss N IrelandManchester Museum of Science and IndustryOut of this world - scientific adventures in spaceAward £4,000Out of this world is an exciting and innovate strand of events, designed to engage andinspire families and the general public with astronomy and space science, showcasingcutting-edge (STFC funded) local research.

It would be presented at two of thebiggest and most high profile music and arts festivals aimed at young people and families inthe UK - Latitude and Camp Bestival. Running in parallel to EXOPLANETS, curious directivewill facilitate star-gazing workshops hosted by local star-gazing experts, in collaboration withthe UK Dark Sky Discovery Network. The hour long sessions will take participants on ajourney through the night's sky, showing them planets within our solar system, and othernearby stars around which other planets have been discovered.Professor AW RobardsYork Science and Innovation Grand TourYork Science and Innovation Grand TourAward £9,500In 2008, York hosted the Grand Tour, which was an outdoor exhibition of reproductions ofpictures from the National Gallery. This exhibition was hugely successful and it is nowintended to follow this up with a unique Science and Innovation Grand Tour taking placebetween May and August 2012. The concept parallels that of the original Grand Tour andwill comprise up to 100 large, high-quality images related to science and innovation whichwill be mounted outside, all over the centre of the historic city of York. Local companies,
universities and other groups are being approached to provide and sponsor such images.The criteria are that each image should be stunning to look at, related to science andinnovation, and have a local connection. Each image will have a "QR code" which will link tosupporting material if read using a smartphone or special handheld reader (available forloan to visitors on supply of a deposit). The QR codes will provide substantial opportunitiesfor 'follow-up' as well as a natural way to gauge visitor numbers and engagement. Thisaward will support five images. These are intended to capture some of the diversity of STFCscience and also to have strong links with York past and present. One of the images will beof John Goodricke (1764-1786), the others will relate to galaxies, black holes, nuclearphysics and the Central Laser Facility.Mr H FirthOrkney International Science FestivalDark Skies and Island Opportunities: Astronomy in OrkneyAward £7,146The project leaders will work with island communities - schools, community groups, tourismbusinesses - to establish in Orkney a network of astronomy projects in order to support thebid of several of the Orkney Isles to become Dark Sky Communities, thereby helping tosupport the winter tourism economy.They will establish five school astronomy clubs, providing them with a quality telescope toallow them to run public stargazing events. There will also be astronomy workshops andtalks, support in developing astronomy projects for the new Scottish Higher Physics, fivepublic talks plus stargazing sessions, an "astronomy residential weekend" in an Orkneyhotel, supporting the Orkney Tourism Group in promoting Orkney as a winter astronomydesignation, surveys around each of the five schools, assisted by pupils, to establish fiveDark Sky Discovery Sites through the Dark Sky Scotland project, ensuring that two of theseschools are on islands outwith the mainland of Orkney, and to carry out dark sky surveys ofthese two islands to support their bid to become International Dark Sky Communities,deliver five astronomy CPD sessions for teachers in the five schools and to deliver oneastronomy training session for tour guides on Orkney.Dr DJ HallThe Open UniversityUKube in the classroom - from space to FukushimaAward £6,780
This project proposes a pilot scheme to build up to the launch of the UK's first CubeSatmission - UKube-1, part of a knowledge transfer partnership sponsored by STFC. The e2vCentre for Electronic Imaging at the Open University are building a camera module to belaunched on the mission to take pictures of the Earth and to study the damage caused tothe camera by radiation in space. It aims to provide students with interactive sessionscomprising of a short talk linking the work to their stage in the science curriculum, hands-onexperience with flight-equivalent camera modules and a question and answer session forthe students so they can find out what they really want to know about the mission.This outreach project aims to develop and demonstrate an outreach strategy for post-launch and future UKube missions where pupils can get hands-on experience with fullyoperational flight-equivalent equipment. It will also engage pupils in frontier research, intheir local area, on the STFC sponsored UKube-1, the UK's pilot CubeSat mission, generateinterest in UKube-1 in the build up to launch and motivate school students to study physicsand engineering beyond 16 and on to university by demonstrating the work of our PhDstudents on the UKube mission.Mrs G LeesYork Museums TrustYork Museums Trust ObservatoryAward £2,900This project will establish the York Museums Trust Observatory as a hub for Astronomyacross the city.

In addition, an online booklet will be produced by the team with support from thestaff at Astronomy Now magazine, which will support the GCSE Astronomy curriculum andbe freely available to UK schools.A teacher training programme to support the ESERO-UK CPD goal for UK teachers will bedeveloped, engaging them with space/astronomy in the classroom, and in this casespecifically targeting the GCSE Astronomy qualification. Four full day GCSE Astronomyteacher training courses for UK secondary school teachers will be held and twilight "taster"sessions to talk to teachers who might be interested in taking up the course in future will beprovided.Dr SJ MontgomeryW5Exploring the Invisible – Infrared and AstronomyAward £9,700This award will enable the development of a 30 minute workshop for school pupilsexplaining infra red as part of the electromagnetic spectrum and how it is used withinastronomy. It aims to develop the workshop for school pupils to explore Infrared, the workof Herschel, how he found Infrared and how it has many exciting and useful applications. Itsother uses from medical, police and security work, to detect heat loss in buildings and tomonitor the Earth's weather will also be illustrated but the main focus will be to explore itsuse in astronomy. It will link the use of infra red in common devices such as remote controlsand laser tag to its use in science.The project will also create a small learning zone linked to infra red and astronomy as anintroduction to a laser tag game at W5 and refurbish and relocate the planet Odysseyexhibit to a permanent position in the learning Zone.Dr AJ SteeleUniversity of OxfordAccelerate! ToolkitAward £9,629Accelerate! is a highly successful particle and accelerator physics demonstration lectureaimed at secondary school pupils and the general public. It was developed at the Universityof Oxford during a two-year programme, funded by a previous STFC Science in Society SmallAward, which saw it delivered to a varied audience of 5000 people. This project will developan informational ‘Accelerate! toolkit’ which would allow universities to host their own
Accelerate! programme, or help schoolteachers make the link between the sciencecurriculum, classroom demonstrations and particle accelerators.Resources will be created allowing production of a modular, 20–60 minute live interactivescience show by universities and outreach groups. Additionally these resources would beusable by teachers to enhance similar demonstrations in the classroom, and link them toparticle and accelerator physics. These resources will comprise 10 high-quality five-minuteinstructional videos aimed at science communicators, and a further 10 demonstrationvideos aimed at students or the general public. It will also create illustrated writtenresources accompanying each video, containing detailed explanations of the science behindthem and the relevance to particle and accelerator physics, relevant mathematics, andfollow-up exercises for use in the classroom. These resources will be published to adedicated section of the Oxford Physics website under a Creative Commons license toencourage widespread use and reuse and at least one training day for universities, includingthe SEPnet consortium, with a target of 20 attendees will be provided.Mr S JagoTechniquestMarsAward £4,758The aim of this project is to develop a new bilingual planetarium show for public audienceson the subject of "Mars", to engage new public audiences in astronomy and current STFCresearch. Techniquest has the only fixed site planetarium in Wales and is a 30 seateducational dome that enables them to show digital projections of the night sky. This awardwill produce a full-dome digital show on Mars. The show will be designed to provide astimulating and immersive public engagement experience that makes full use of a newdigital projector and will inspire new audiences to be interested and motivated inastronomy and cosmology. The show will be developed bilingually (English/Welsh) to enableit to meet the needs of the Welsh public audiences.The show will last for approximately 40 minutes, consisting of a digital presentation on Marsfollowed by a tour of the night sky which will be presenter-led. Moving images, animationand music will be used to create a show that maximises the potential of the new projectorand enables new audiences to explore the Red Planet. The show will enable the audience totake a virtual trip to Mars and tour it from an exploration rover and the audience willobserve and increase its awareness of some of Mars’ distinct and interesting features. Theshow will be followed by a star tour. For the majority of beneficiaries this will be their firstvisit to a planetarium and it will provide an immersive and exciting way to engage them intoastronomy. Any cross-over between topics within the show and the current night sky will bemade explicit. Links to the myths around Mars will be used to explore the constellations.The show will highlight where and when Mars will be visible in the night sky.
Professor BC AllanachUniversity of CambridgeGuerilla Science 2012Award £5,000Guerilla Science intends to build on their previous activities at music festivals and eventswhere science is unexpected. It will further establish their work in the festival environmentand create events for other non-science environments. In 2012 the aim is to bring science-orientated discussion, debate, art, music, experiments, demonstrations and talks to theSecret Garden Party in Cambridgeshire in July 2012 and one other UK music festival. Outsideof the music festival season they will develop and run events in order to test out newelements of the program and provide training for participants.In the Guerilla Science tent, using a blend of discussion, debate, live experiments, talks andperformances, Guerilla Science aims to communicate various aspects of science andtechnology to a general public audience. Activities and events featuring STFC relevantcontent will be conducted under the overarching theme of Exploring the Universe. Eventcontent will primarily include events inspired by quantum physics and the LHC, spacescience, astronomy and maths. Within this overarching theme they will seek to programmore events themed around solar maxima, cosmic microwave background and theformation of galaxies and stars. The informal atmosphere is facilitated by hands-onexperiments and activities as well as science-orientated music, art, films and documentaries.Dr SM WilkinsUniversity of OxfordAstronomy Playing CardsAward £3,250This award will facilitae the production of 1000 sets (each set contains 5 decks totatling 125cards per set) of astronomy themed cards. The sets will be distributed to schools inOxfordshire and those offering Astronomy GCSE free of charge, as well as being used duringpublic outreach events organised by Oxford Physics. They will introduce school children (<14years) to various astrophysical phenomenon as well as give them a wider understanding ofthe scale of the Universe. Each individual pack (25 cards with a common theme) can be usedto play various comparison games where players compare properties of objects they hold todetermine a winner. The primary aim of this part of the activity is to develop knowledge ofthe various astrophysical phenomenons (planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies etc.) andan intuition of astrophysical properties (luminosity, eccentricity etc.) and units (e.g.astronomical units, solar masses, light years etc.)Mr PR WinfieldINTECH
Mission Control, Exploring the Frontiers of Modern AstrophysicsAward £8,000The purpose of this project is to deliver an interactive exhibit at the INTECH Science Centre& Planetarium for large-scale, public engagement activities in astrophysics. The target is toimplement an appropriate suite of high-level visualisation tools for content delivery overcommon mobile platforms, e.g. smartphones and tablets, by exploiting cutting-edge high-performance computational infrastructures, e.g. desktop grids. The plan is to initiallyemploy an area in the exhibition at the INTECH Science Centre & Planetarium forshowcasing a number of grid-enabled visualisation technologies based on VisIVO, a high-performance environment for astrophysical visualisation.The ultimate vision for the proposed exhibit is to provide a foundation for developingAstroExplorer, an on-line multiplayer computer game involving several other science centresin the UK for very large-scale, public engagement networks in astrophysics. Once thetechnology has been developed for the proposed exhibit it will be made freely available toother science centres in the UK via the Association for Science & Discovery Centres (ASDC)network. Other science centres will then be able to construct similar exhibits allowingseemless connection to AstroExplorer simply by adding their own hardware and computingresources. The ultimate aim of the proposed project is to inspire young people aboutastronomy and cosmology by offering them access to highly specialised astronomicaldatasets and tools to which they would not normally be exposed and motivating them toundertake visual discovery journeys. This includes presenting modern astrophysical datasetsin innovative ways that are accessible, intriguing and enjoyable.Dr HF HeathUniversity of BristolCosmic BalloonsAward £6,400The Bristol Balloon fiesta is a major annual event held at the Ashton Court Estate in Bristoland attracts about 500,000 visitors every year in August. This award will fund a stall at theFiesta and arrange a competition for 6th formers with the prize being a trip in a hot airballoon. There will be a cosmic-ray detector in the balloon with live telementry to the stallon the ground. It is hoped to have sufficient bandwidth to allow a simple bi-directional videolink. Some of the materials produced will also be used at other events in particular "Discover2012" which is a biennial event where the University of Bristol takes over the central area ofa local shopping centre to "sell" science.The award will enable the hire a marquee, production of display materials including a"cosmic ray doorway" entrance. The university’s spark chamber will also be used. Thisnature of this event is such that audiences who would not normally attend a science eventwill be reached where the main aim the project is to use the occasion of the 100thanniversary of the discovery of cosmic rays to promote to a general Bristol audience the
significance of cosmic rays and the contribution to cosmic ray research made by local NobelPrize winner Cecil Powell.Mr B MadisonRAL SpaceMars Mission Control @your SchoolAward £10,000The project would use the Mars-like test area and the outreach robots at RAL Space to hostremote workshops to schools across the country. The schools would receive an introductionpack or an introductory webinar before they could take control of the Mars rovers and withthe use of the on-board camera, other sensors and actuators, complete educationalmissions. Schools only need a computer with a web-browser, and they can control a realrobot on "Mars". The rovers will be placed in the Mars-like test area and images from theon-board camera will be shown in the control interface. Students will then have tocomplete the task described in the activity (e.g. Sample return, exploration of a specific areaor cave, repair equipment. Once they completed the task (with directions provided in theactivity pack) the teacher can review what the class have achieved and learned during theactivity.Some of the aims of the project are to build two new rovers, produce an introduction packor video tutorials for activities and hold some school sessions to test the activities. Theaward will also mean that the team can set up an infrastructure at RAL Space which can beused to deliver educational and engaging hands-on activities to any school in the UKremotely with minimal time required from technical staff, deliver an interactive web-sitewhich can be used by schools using any web-browser (including the ones on smart-phonesand tablets).Successful applicants in round 2012AMr Derek McKaySTFC Laboratories – RAL SpaceThe LOFAR PlanetariumAward £9,984The aim of this project is to display the invisible, radio universe to the general public using aconventional planetarium. The planetarium has remained a key way to engage the public inastronomy. It provides a controlled, weather-independent environment that allows manyaspects of astronomy to be explored in a way that is easy to grasp by the students and thegeneral public.Radio astronomy on the other hand, remains intangible as it is difficult to relate it directly tothe experiences of ordinary people. Furthermore, many radio astronomy techniques do notlend themselves well to wide-field all-sky images, precluded by the designs of their
experiments. This project aims to use the power of the planetarium to relate the radio skyto the optical one, but to do so at a level which allows comprehension of the scale,placement and form of this invisible universe.The project intends to take data from the UK's new LOFAR (Low Frequency Array) radiotelescope. Unlike conventional telescopes, the LOFAR system has wide field of view and alarge number of internal baselines. This allows individual stations to map huge regions ofthe sky instantaneously. It is intended to convert these data into a format that can be usedin a planetarium. A modest set of observations would be taken with the LOFAR-UK station atChilbolton and then converted into a format that can be imported into a digital planetarium.Additional material, also part of the project, will provide the resources necessary to allowpresenters and teachers to follow-up public shows with more detailed information, either aspart of class-work, lectures or static displays. By using the planetarium, we will be able topresent often overlooked information to large audiences, thus reach large numbers ofpeople in a way that is normally not available.Dr Aiden RobsonUniversity of GlasgowParticle Physics for FifeAward £1,500The aim of this project is to run a public engagement day during the Scottish UniversitiesSummer School in Physics "LHC Physics", it will host around 250 secondary school pupilsfrom 3rd to 6th year (i.e. aged 14-17) for a programme tailored to their age and level ofknowledge, it will also host up to 250 adult members of the public for a similar programmein the evening.The programme will include - a lecture by a well-known British particle physicist, hands-onexperiments and displays, provided by the Particle Physics for Scottish Schools project(PP4SS), and by the University of Glasgow Experimental Particle Physics group andaccompanied by summer school participants.The event will be held at St Andrews University and the visitors will be introduced to theideas of particle physics and to the scientific methods that we use, with focus on the LHCand its physics and related applications.Dr Gabrielle ProvanUniversity of LeicesterAurora Explorer – on tour!Award £5,950
This award is to exhibit the 'Cluster: Aurora Explorer' Exhibition at the British ScienceFestival in Aberdeen in September 2012. It will inspire, enthuse and educate the generalpublic, families and pupils about the Earth's near-space environment using the Cluster spacemission and the Planeterrella as 'inspirational hooks'. It will present the latest scientificdiscoveries from the Cluster space mission to a wide general audience, encourage adialogue between scientists and the general public and engage with the AmateurAstronomy community, commencing scientific dialogues on topics such as magnetosphericand auroral physics.In 2011 the 'Cluster: Aurora Explorer' exhibit was successfully presented at the Royal SocietySummer Exhibition (RSSE) to an audience number of ~14000 people. The exhibit celebrated10 years of the Cluster space mission, and engaged the public in the importance of spaceweather and auroral physics through a wide and extensive exhibit from six differentinstitutes.The event at Aberdeen will be a fantastic opportunity to share this science with a potentialaudience of tens of thousands. The exhibit is especially relevant this year, as solar activity isincreasing and the aurora was visible from Scotland early in 2012. Furthermore at the BritishScience Festival the exhibit will be co-located with the annual conference of the BritishAstronomical Association giving the opportunity to engage directly with the amateurastronomy community. As part of the exhibition the 'Planeterrella' will be presented, whichhas been funded and supported by two STFC small awards.Dr Benjamin StillQueen Mary, University of LondonJiggling AtomsAward £6,000This project involves up to 20 artists conveying core concepts in particle physics throughdiverse and imaginative artworks, workshops and lectures. The resources developed will beaccessible through a Jiggling Atoms publication and website and will ultimately culminate inan exhibition and event for all ages.The Jiggling Atoms publication will include an edited selection of the artistic visualisationsproduced by the artists, as well as support text written by the Award holder. It will includeessays on physics visualisation as well as documentation of the lectures and details of theproject progress.The website will host recorded videos of the lectures and downloadable PDF scripts, it willschedule the programme of events and serve as a platform for discussion and feedbackutilising current social networking.The Jiggling Atoms event and exhibition (1st -14th October 2012 at the Rag Factory venuejust off Brick Lane) will be open to all ages with workshops, exhibited artwork, lectures,
installations and guided tours. There will be workshops and guided tours of the exhibition,exploring the physical concepts, the involvement of contributing artists and curators inschool workshops and events, ensuring that the content is accessible to all age groups.School groups will be invited to visit the installation and participate in the workshopsthrough University outreach connections and curator connections.Dr Helen VaughanUniversity of LiverpoolNuclear Physics Workshops, Summer School and Open DayAward £9,530This award will enable the holder to deliver and embed a series of nuclear physicsworkshops for 14 - 15 year old (Year 10 KS 4) pupils to enhance the physics curriculum inMerseyside. The interactive workshops will take place in the classroom at a key point in thepupils' science education to motivate them to higher achievement at KS4 (GCSE) and above.There will be a focus on the real world application of nuclear science to open pupils' mindsto the possibility of varied physics careers here in the North West and the whole of the UK.Thirty pupils (representing 10 schools) will attend a 3-day Nuclear Physics Summer School(NPSS) at the newly-built Central Teaching Laboratories to give them an in-depth view ofnuclear science, through using cutting-edge experimental equipment and a research project.This will culminate in an Open Morning for participating schools and families withdemonstrations and activities aimed at widening the understanding of nuclear science andthe career choices available by taking A Level Physics. This sustained interaction with thepupils will motivate pupils and teachers to considering the benefits of continuing in physicseducation.Ms Arrow LeeUniversity College LondonOutreach for PoleCATS (Polar test of the Conceptual and Tiny Spectrometer)Award £5,960The aim of this project is to use PoleCATS (a student-designed payload on a sounding rocketas part of the REXUS (Rocket EXperiments for University Students) programme), which is anexisting student project originating from STFC research in space instrumentation, to linktogether scientific and technological concepts with a real project which school children canfollow through websites and social networking and use as a basis for further work within theclassroom.
It is envisaged that the activities and presentations developed could be used equally wellwith members of the public. This would generate interest in space research, and science ingeneral, amongst school children and members of the public, raise awareness of the impactof space weather and the efforts being taken to further our understanding of it. It would usea real rocket launch to capture the imagination of young children and show where studyingSTEM subjects can lead, generating an increased interest in STEM subjects, providing a focusand context for the teaching of science and technology curriculum topics (e.g. forces, spaceexploration, spectrometers, electronics).The project would create materials to present space weather and its impacts, compile theactivity and materials into a resource which can be used by others either on visits to schoolsor when students/members of the public visit MSSL. The events would also be presented toat least 5 local schools and/or community groups, developing an on-going link with severallocal schools, starting with an introductory afternoon of activities, based on the above, andcontinuing with visits and/or e-mails/blogs to update the school on the progress of thePoleCATS project. A website will also be developed so that school children and the generalpublic can follow the development of the project and can be used by children and teachersbeyond school visits.Ms Alice SharpInvisible DustInvisible HeatAward £9,974Invisible Heat is a cross disciplinary art science project, which aims to educate peopleinitially in Southampton about RAL Space Science use of infrared to measure sea surfacetemperature and Climate Change. Its rationale is that many areas of science are invisible (inthis case infrared) and so difficult for people to understand.This project will provide young people with an imaginative and stimulating way of engagingwith STFC science through the ground breaking research of the Rutherford AppletonLaboratory space scientist, Dr Hugh Mortimer, who works to validate climate data for thepurpose of climate change research, one of the most interesting and controversial areas ofscience. The young people will create videos to exhibit with artists to be shown initially inSouthampton where the Queen Mary 2 docks, and then at the Royal Observatory.By collaborating with artists who work with many tools, such as sound, installation, visualand other; the invisible is made visible. The project will engage 15 young people, many fromdeprived rural areas near Southampton with STFC Space Science and how it is related toclimate change through Dr Mortimer’s research; the results will be their own creation of artvideos containing satellite images and film footage from archives. Following the creation oftheir artwork, it is intended to show it to 20,000 people at the Southampton Film Festival,
the Royal Observatory with 1.6 million audiences p.a and on the Queen Mary 2 with 300,000visitors p.a.The young people will be provided with science workshops on infrared, the RALinstrumentation on the Queen Mary 2 and the satellite measurement of sea surfacetemperature with a Science Educator. They will then develop digital art skills with artist GaryStewart and use satellite images and the RAL Space archive to edit the images together tocreate their own videos. As well as the above venues, it is hoped that they will show theirwork to their whole school through events and screenings at assemblies which will involve1215 school students.Dr Judith PillingerThe Open UniversityMaking an Impact Phase 2 - Wiltshire's meteorite comes homeAward £3,700The primary aim of this project is to provide wide public access to the meteorite from LakeHouse, Wiltshire in a major Museum near to where it was most recently known to haverested. Whilst the meteorite remains in private ownership, this route will ensure that itsinspirational value can best be exploited. By virtue of its size and weight (almost 100 kg) ithas a wow factor on seeing it for the first time. Coupled with the intriguing - and as yetunfinished - detective trail being followed to find out where it has been for the 30,000 yearsit has been on Earth, it makes a great talking piece as an introduction to space science,planets and extra-terrestrial exploration in general. Because the historic trail is stillincomplete, there are opportunities for visitors to assist with our research, a compellingreason for engaging fully with the exhibit and its context.By focussing a series of events (including the STFC lunar and meteorite loan package)around the opening of the display in Salisbury in September, different audiences will becatered for. Lectures and talks will be aimed at the general public and other professionalssuch as local archaeologists. The Museum will use meteorites as a way of reaching harder toengage audiences, the 14-16 year old students and +16s, age groups and the Learning andOutreach Officer of the Museum will put together an education programme and plans toput on special sessions during the two weeks of the STFC sample loan. The series of eventsoffers an ideal opportunity for new research students to gain experience of talking abouttheir research and outreach methods in general.The project will also enable the design and manufacture of a secure purpose-built displaycabinet necessary for its safe display, design and produce clear and engaging graphics (3panels) to interpret the meteorite for the visitor, use the meteorite as a focal point of thetwo week period in September, during which a lecture on the history of the meteorite and
the analytical science so far carried out will be delivered by Prof Colin Pillinger in theMuseum's successful monthly lecture series which focus on archaeology.Dr Daniel BrownNottingham Trent UniversitySupporting Dark Sky Communities in the ParkAward £9,675This project aims to continue the work started by the previously STFC funded project"Astronomy in the Park – Landscape and Skyscape", when the project sought to raiseawareness of astronomy in audiences not normally engaged in, and at locations notconventionally associated with, astronomy.Outreach events in the form of public walks and talks, as well as the use of an inflatableplanetarium, will be used to directly engage over 400 people from all over the country. Theprojects aim to give everyone the opportunity to learn about the links between culturalheritage and astronomy, and how they are being lost due to light pollution. In addition tothe above, the project also wants to actively encourage communities within the NationalPark to take responsibility for the conservation of the night skies in their local area. Tofacilitate this, another aim is to create an award for communities that commit to worktowards the reduction of light pollution within their local area. This will be done byintroducing these communities to astronomy through education events, hands ondemonstrations of astronomical equipment, and working towards creating self-supportingDark Sky Discovery sites within their local area.The overall impact of this project will be the realisation that astronomy can be explored byeveryone and linking observations with images provided by STFC funded facilities, such asSDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory), Herschel and VLT (Very Large Telescope), not only willparticipants explore the impact of light pollution on these observations and on their culturalheritage, but the grass-roots approach will also allow the communities to claim ownershipof their site and feel responsible for its maintenance ensuring a long lasting legacy. Theoutcomes of this project will be further used to improve supporting such learning andteaching in schools. Most importantly the Dark Sky group - network of amateur astronomerassociations, universities, and the Peak District National Park Authority (PDNPA) - will bebuilding upon the increase awareness in their educational work towards tackling lightpollution and establishing a Dark Sky Reserve.Ms Carol JahmeFlickering LtdShake SphereAward £9,800
Shake Sphere aims to exploit the Shakespearean focus of the Cultural Olympiad. Differentperspectives on Shakespeare's impact on the world's stage will be seen at events andvenues such as The British Museum, The Globe, The RSC International Shakespeare Festival(ISF) etc. Shakespeare was a scientifically prescient writer and the Elizabethan era heraldedthe birth of modern science. Francis Bacon promoted the scientific method, knewShakespeare and some say that Bacon is the true author due to the high science content.But Shake Sphere is the only event that will examine science.The RSC consider Shake Sphere's focus on science to be extremely important and viewShake Sphere as a legacy project of the ISF. The RSC will collaborate on the project in theAutumn of 2012 and the Spring of 2013 on shared public events. Taking to the streets ofLondon during the Cultural Olympiad Shake Sphere entertain and surprise the public bymaking a comparison between STFC science and Elizabethan methods. Two actors will beused to communicate dramatised facts to the public. One actor will be an omnipotentElizabethan "Alchemist", a barber surgeon who taught people such as Shakespeare, Dr Dee,Bacon, Galileo, Paracelcus and Walter Raleigh everything they know. As a product ofElizabethan times he is confused to be transported forwards 400 years. The other actor willbe an omnipotent personification of STFC Frontier Science; called "STFC" this character willamaze "Alchemist" with how things have changed. With centuries of innovation anddiscovery between them, there will be much to bicker about and plenty of opportunity forjokes.The audiences will be involved and asked to score points as the actors compete to top oneanother with gentlemanly banter and one-upmanship as they discuss fascinating sciencefacts and relevant Shakespearean quotes. The Alchemist will keep wrongly diagnosinghorrifying Elizabethan diseases in the audience and advocating equally horrifyingElizabethan remedies. With a focus on specific areas of research several scenarios havebeen devised enabling the actors to engage with the public. At the end of each scene the"Alchemist" will have to concede that "STFC" is a powerful wizard & many Elizabethanmethods such as dried toad, blood-letting and mercury injections have been surpassed - but"STFC" will have to concede that Shakespeare's writing never has been. With their new,mutual understanding Alchemist and STFC depart the best of friends, moving to a new siteto start over with a new audience. Shake Sphere pop-up will entertain Cultural Olympiadaudiences with science-theatre busking from 11th July to 9th September.Dr Fraser ClarkeUniversity of OxfordStargazing Oxfordshire: University Researchers and Community Astronomers bringingSpace Science to the PublicAward £6,000
This award will fund a programme of open evenings and events at Oxford Physics andMarlborough College, including lectures, activities and observing workshops, and acontinued collaboration with the BBC at the "Stargazing Oxford" space science festival,reaching a total of over two thousand visitors over the year of the award. There will also bea series of outdoor astronomy events for families, schools and other general publicthroughout the year, in collaboration with local astronomy societies, Science Oxford, andRAL.The project aims to educate and inspire audiences from diverse backgrounds via access tothe night sky with large and small telescopes, promote and demystify current astronomicalresearch and the scientific method , support public involvement in observational astronomy,via their local community astronomy groups, bring together teachers, pupils and youthgroups with graduate researchers and establish a community astronomy network, with theobservatories in Oxford and Marlborough as central nodes.Dr Emma WeitkampUniversity of the West of EnglandSpaceJunkies: a comic platform for astronomy engagementAward £9,949This project seeks to engage young people (11 - 14) with astronomy and space researchthrough a multimedia platform. It will include a narrative story which will be delivered in 5instalments using a comic/visual format and feature articles that discuss the science 'behind'the narrative storyline. There will be up to 5 videos, a 'question of the week' inviting emailresponses and/or a call for questions from readers, both would offer a small prize for thebest response/question, 2 short polls/quizzes that build on the narrative content andfeature article materials.The narrative story will be built using a series of 5 weekly instalments. The story will bedelivered using a traditional comic format comprising visual images of the action and textboxes for dialogue.The narrative stories will use traditional devices, such as cliff-hangers, to encourage youngpeople to return to the site on a weekly basis. Narratives will be designed to highlight theimportance of space science and astronomy research. The narrative will be framed around aparticular area of space research which will be agreed following initial work with youngpeople to identify the most appealing topics. However, it is likely that the narrative willfocus around a near earth object (to tie in with predictions of the end of the world in 2012)or with the Solar StormWatch programme.Successful applicants in round 2012B
Miss Suzanne EnsomEnglish-Speaking Union ScotlandSpeak Up ScotlandAward £9,860This is the extension of a project begun last year, where the group were able to create adebates handbook for science teachers, and a website (www.speakupscotland.org.uk). Theproject also ran debating workshops for science teachers, organised scientist visits toschools (through the STEM Ambassadors programme) & set up a national science debatingcompetition. Feedback from the teachers showed they found it useful to do the activitiesthemselves. This funding will enable the project to run a more detailed workshopprogramme for teachers and pupils, create new science resources and continue toencourage discussion between scientists and young people. The idea is to get young peopletalking and arguing about science- good communication skills meet cutting edge science.The skills learned during debating, such as objective critical evaluation, are very valuable indeveloping scientifically literate and engaged citizens - as well as being useful in everydaylife.As a result, highly practical and interactive debates workshops for science teachersproviding a range of debates techniques which can be used with the whole class will beheld, printed and online classroom resources for Nuclear Energy will be produced & willcomprise of debates motions, key research, questions to ask, where to get moreinformation; and lesson planning notes. These will be freely available to all schools. DebatesDVDs covering all aspects of debate from initial research and brainstorming arguments to aninformal debate format will also be produced & will also be available as clips on the website,and through a You Tube channel which will be set up. Pupil workshops will be held for alimited number of participating schools, which will include debates activities andbrainstorming arguments to create a coherent debate and scientist visits will be organisedto help foster links with the science community.Ms Amanda TyndallEdinburgh International Science FestivalPatterns - Revealing Nature's Underlying Order and FormAward £10,000'Patterns' aims to deliver a high-impact, large-scale, outdoor exhibition that will explore,through a series of glorious full colour images and sculpture, the science of patternformation in nature.Launched at the end of January 2013 and running for 12 weeks, 'Patterns' will be theflagship public offering of the 25th Anniversary Festivals, linking to a suite of activities acrossScotland in celebration of the Scottish Government's 'Year of Natural Scotland'. Free, openand accessible, the exhibition will provide a valuable platform for reaching new audiences. It
will form a valuable part of continued attempts to make science and technology easilyaccessible to those not necessarily engaged with, or targeted by, most traditional sciencecommunication activity. Curated from a selection of world-class collections, a selection ofup to 45 images and a number of specially chosen sculptural works will reveal some of themyriad of eye-popping visual formations that colour and pattern our world and will explainthe role that the laws of maths and physics - the forces of nature - play in the manifestationof this astonishing order and regularity. From the patterns on a butterfly's wings, to thewindblown ripples of desert sand, the allure of snowflakes and crystals, and the spirals ofgalaxies, our world is full of beauty, symmetry and complexity. Science and technology cannot only explain WHY this is the case but can - through the use of cutting-edge imagerytechniques - also reveal these patterns in all their glory.The event is outdoors, free, and in a prominent location in the centre of Edinburgh (StAndrew Square) that over the duration of the exhibition will be frequented by a milliontourists, workers and young people, thus providing a valuable platform for reaching newaudiences. It will educate and inform visitors with impactful and interesting descriptionsthat will feature alongside the images describing the area of science, research andtechnology used to explore the subject of the image.The exhibition will attract a minimum of 140,000 visitors with a selection of at least 45images from the best image collections worldwide, (at least a quarter of which will linkdirectly into STFC-grant-funded science areas) and large-scale versions will be reproducedfor display. The exhibition will also incorporate at least 1 piece of dramatic sculpture. Theexhibition will be available for hire/loan to other organisations around the UK, so that it canreach beyond the Edinburgh objectives, increasing public engagement in science across thecountry.Dr David BermanQueen Marys University of LondonThe Higgs and Beyond: exploring particle physics today - and in the futureAward £8,816.00This project will develop a substantial package of public and schools engagement material(aimed principally at A-level and GCSE students and their teachers), based on STFC-fundedresearch into particle physics. It aims to harness the current excitement in particle physicsgenerated by the discovery of the Higgs Boson, to promote and explain the nature ofresearch in high energy particle physics. Complementing this, it will highlight the human sideof research, with case studies of the day-to-day work and careers of STFC-funded PhDstudents and researchers.The package will include inspirational articles exploring physics research, interviews withSTFC-funded academics exploring both their research area and their personal experiences ofworking in science, interviews with STFC PHD students who have left academia (with anemphasis on the impact of their PhD work in the non-academic world), and linked engaging
problems for Key Stage 5 and Key Stage 4 students, exploring the topics involved at anaccessible and appropriate level. Complementing the online content, the project will alsoproduce a set of attractive and engaging hardcopy A3 posters for distribution to schools andlibraries, providing accessible edited highlights of the project content and thought-provoking and engaging problems. Examples of the types of topic areas the project maycover include: the search for supersymmetry, neutrino physics, the search for dark matterand engineering aspects of the LHC.Mr Gregory WatsonChildren’s Radio UK LtdDeep Space High - Space CampAward £9,350.00STFC previously funded a series of speech features through Children’s Radio UK Ltd, entitled'Deep Space High'. The aim was to engage with children, introduce and highlight the fun sideof space, and inspire children and parents to find out more, either through organisededucation or as a recreational interest. The series have been broadcast on Fun Kids sinceJuly 2012, are available to listen again on the Fun Kids website and iPad app, and as freedownloads on iTunes. A dedicated micro-site was also created on the Fun Kids website.This grant will enable 3 further mini-series to look at more detailed aspects of spaceexploration and Britain's involvement in these. The new series will follow the Deep SpaceHigh teachers and pupils as they embark on field trips to explore the Earth and the Sun, aswell as the UK's involvement in space exploration. The informative and inspirationalfeatures will be written for a core child audience aged 9 to 12 years, although both youngerand older children will also listen to the features, as well as parents and carers. A secondarybenefit is therefore encouraging parents and older siblings to also discover and perhapsdevelop a family plan to learn more. These will be broadcast over a four month period &permanently available online, through the iPad app & downloadable through iTunes.Mr Simon JagoTechniquestThe Search for LifeAward £10,000The aim of this project is to develop an engaging, facilitated public full dome planetariumprogramme to engage new audiences in the STFC research associated with the "Search forLife". The project will be supported by an additional school show (funded by WelshGovernment) and publically available online resources. The show will be developed for usein small horizontal domes and portable planetaria meeting a current gap in provision. It isanticipated that the project will inspire up to 6,700 public visitors per year in astronomy,
cosmology and current STFC research, reaching up to 33,000 people over the next 5 years. Itwill engage up to 1,000 upper Key Stage 2 pupils (9 -11 year olds) per year, in STFC researchand science in-line with the national curriculum. It will also develop online supportingresources and distribute them to the National STEM Library for public use.The show will reach new audiences including those who previously would have had noinvolvement in Astronomy i.e. individual adults, public audiences and family groups as it willbe developed for use by horizontal and mobile domes, meeting a current gap in provision.The programme will be able to be replicated at other venues and with other organisationsacross Wales and the rest of the UK.Miss Alice MasseyFuel TheatreHow Far Can You SeeAward £1,600The key aim of the project is to deliver a panel discussion at the Young Vic theatre in Londonon 18 December, before the evening show of Sound&Fury's Going Dark. This paneldiscussion will be open to the public, and free to attend, and will be entitled 'How Far CanYou See? A discussion on light and sight - the limitations of seeing and the indirectness ofsight'. This discussion aims to inform and enthuse audiences about the dynamics of vision -how it is applied to both cosmic views and the everyday world we live in.To make audiences aware of how visual perception and optics have been a key aid toastronomy, and how sight is a fragile tool in our perceptual understanding of the world andthe universe beyond. It will offer audiences an understanding of how the brain interpretsimages, and how we make sense of a vast cosmos stretching the limits of our perception.The overall impact of the project will be a deeper understanding of and enthusiasm for thescientific themes explored in Going Dark.To deliver an informative and intriguing discussion that looks at sight and vision from anumber of perspectives. Up to 100 members of the public will be able to attend thediscussion, which will be documented and the film published on the Fuel website, in orderto widen public engagement.
Miss Amy OxleyWyvil Primary SchoolOval Cluster KS2 Mission to SpaceAward £5,265.00This project will take place across 9 cluster primary schools in Lambeth during the academicyear 2012-13. Children from across Key Stage 2 will take part depending on which year thetopic of "Space" is taught in their school. It will consist of a number of workshops in clusterschools and visits across the city to inspire and engage children in their science learning anddevelop their knowledge and understanding of space. Children, staff and parents from thelocal community will be invited to a number of events exploring aspects of space science,from the solar system, rockets to space food. These will be interactive, combining variouslearning styles, will include cross curricular links to literacy, numeracy, art and design, ICT,technology and drama. We will invite organisations such as the National Space Centre &Spaceflight UK to deliver workshops & in addition to the workshops; the children involvedwill take part in trips to visit the Science Museum for a space themes day & the PeterHarrison Planetarium at the Royal Greenwich Museum. Some of the aims of this project is tobroaden children's knowledge and understanding of the solar system and space science, toincrease children's engagement in Science, develop children's skills in research, teamwork,communication, presentation, ICT and data handling & to develop teacher's understandingof the solar system and space science, encouraging them to use diverse interactive creativemethods to teach primary space science.The children's engagement in Science and knowledge and understanding of space science atthe start & at end of the project will be monitored using focus groups of pupils and pupilsurveys, to monitor the impact on children participating in the exciting programme of spacebased activities.An addition to the positive outcomes for pupils the project will also inspire the teachersinvolved and give them a wider range of ideas and resources for teaching about Space infuture years. A Written report on the project will be produced including activities andevaluations & impact and this will be circulated to the other 60 Primary Schools in Lambethusing the termly Cluster Managers' network forum. Information about the project will alsobe in our school and cluster newsletters & websites.Ms Liz MerminCrow Hill Films LtdMinds over Matter: CERN People filmsAward £10,000This project, CERN People is a series of short films (eight x 3 minute internet films, for whichthe primary viewing venues will be the YouTube channel, CERN People, and CERN PeopleGoogle+ page) that go behind the headlines of two huge breakthroughs in particle physics
which took place this year. Filming at CERN has been taking place throughout 2012. The aimis to give the general public a personal sense of who world-class particle physicists are andwhat they actually do. With access to LHC teams searching for the Higgs, Supersymmetry,and exotics, filming was taking place when the Higgs results were coming together, andwhen a ground-breaking anti-matter paper was accepted for publication.This will be a series of un-intimidating, intelligent, informal short films that open the dooronto the thrills and headaches of world-class experimental particle physicists. They focusprimarily on younger physicists, who don't speak to the cameras when big news isannounced but stay up all night analysing data, preparing graphs, and tweaking the tools onwhich big experiments' results depend.The films are in the end about the practical nature of the pursuit of pure knowledge, and theinspirational people pursuing it.Dr Helen MasonUniversity of CambridgeSun/Trek – Reaching OutAward £9,200The main aim of this project is to capitalise on the recent work with Sun|trek, iSun|trek andSun|trek Facebook, and to reach out to UK schools, to promote Sun|trek, in particular theClassroom Resources and Projects, as widely as possible. This will be achieved over a twoyear period by updates and improvements to the Sun|trek site (and related iSun|trek site)and by actively promoting Sun|trek, in particular the classroom resources and projectsavailable for schools, more widely across the UK and Ireland. The wider aim is to enhancethe UK resources available to teachers, which can be used to enthuse students about solarastronomy and to encourage students to study the physical sciences at sixth form andbeyond. Particular efforts will be made to target inner city schools with diverse ethnicgroups. The legacy will be the provision of resources, but also the involvement of youngsolar researchers to continue their own outreach work.Sun|trek will be promoted nationally with talks, e.g. at IoP Teacher workshops, ASEmeetings, NLC and by school visits. Articles will be written for popular and schoolmagazines, the press and newsletters, and Sun|trek will be linked more actively to schoolresources sites (e.g. STEM resources and ESERO).
Ms Christine WatkinsCentre for Performance Research LtdAfter Hours at the Polestar ClubAward £8,314The aim of this award is to produce a new piece of cabaret style performance which engagesa general audience in the intriguing story of Earth's magnetosphere, the solar wind and theaurora - and how our understanding of these phenomena has developed. The story will betold through an original monologue and cycle of songs. This sung and spoken narrative willunfold alongside a series of projected images which are developed and worked into live onstage by a digital drawing artist – a process in which members the audience can alsoparticipate. This project is timed to coincide with the 2013 solar maximum, building onadditional public awareness of the earth-sun relationship that might be generated at thistime, and will have a legacy extending into 2014/15.This will be a pilot project, including 5 initial performances, in different styles of venue andcontext which will test the format and ensure it is a flexible and engaging piece of work totour on successfully in 2014/5. Initially, an Invited Preview will be staged, jointly hosted bythe joint creators, Centre for Performance Research and the Institute of Physics andMathematics, to which festival programmers and others who have offered to organise andsupport future performances will be invited, as well as staff and students from bothparticipating departments within the University. This will incorporate a post-showdiscussion as an extension of this Preview performance, where each table will beencouraged to come up with a combined comment/critique. These will be recorded, withpermission, for use in internal evaluation and forward planning.Dr Andrew CunninghamLiverpool John Moores UniversitySchools Engineering ChallengeAward £5,737This project aims to develop an inter schools competition, to inspire young people tocontinue into higher education and pursue a career in science and engineering in the future.It will develop a problem based learning activity to be run with local schools in conjunctionwith National Museums Liverpool (it is hoped that the event will be held on an annual basiswith Liverpool Museums). The project will be based on the Lunar Rovers with teachingmaterials being developed; research and resources identified and publicised to raise generalawareness of the work. The project will be launched in conjunction with National MuseumsLiverpool and 12 local secondary schools.For the competition the students will be tasked with the design and build of their own LunarRovers from a given set of resources, this will expose them to some higher level systems andcontrol skills as well as allowing them to develop some of the softer transferrable skills
associated with group work. The practical aspects of this project link very closely with theNational curriculum for science. The students will need to build a repeatable 'vehicle' -which can be any movable device - wheeled, walking, sliding, jumping, rolling or other,which must then perform certain tasks.It is envisaged that the project run, year on year, into the future and increase the exposureof young people to professional engineering projects and cutting edge research in thesector. The project would run as an extracurricular activity offered to A-level students inregional schools to encourage students to choose science, engineering and related subjects,where very little is done to encourage the A-Level students to follow these subjects intohigher education.
